🏦 ATM Simulator (Java Console Application)
📌 Overview

This is a Java-based ATM Simulator Project.
It simulates real-world ATM operations such as cash withdrawal, deposit, balance inquiry, and transaction history.
The project demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts and user interaction with the console.

⚡ Features

🔑 PIN authentication for secure login

💵 Cash Withdrawal with balance check

💰 Cash Deposit updates balance

📊 Balance Inquiry anytime

📝 Transaction History stored and displayed

🚪 Exit option to end session

🛠️ Tech Used

Language: Java

Concepts:

Classes & Objects (OOP)

Encapsulation (private balance, PIN)

Lists (for storing transaction history)

Loops & Switch case (for transaction menu)

Scanner (for user input)
