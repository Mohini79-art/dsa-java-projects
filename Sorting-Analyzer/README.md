Sorting Algorithm Analyzer (Java + DSA)
📌 Project Overview

Sorting Algorithm Analyzer is a Java-based analytical tool that helps users understand which sorting algorithm is best suited for a given dataset based on its characteristics such as data order, disorder level, and size.

Instead of blindly applying a sorting algorithm, this project focuses on decision-making using DSA concepts, similar to how real systems optimize performance.

🎯 Problem Statement

In real-world applications, developers often apply sorting algorithms without analyzing:

whether the data is already sorted or nearly sorted

the performance impact of the chosen algorithm

time and space trade-offs

This leads to inefficient execution and unnecessary performance loss.

💡 Solution

This project:

analyzes the nature of input data

evaluates disorder level

compares multiple sorting algorithms

recommends the most optimal algorithm with justification

The system also provides:

time & space complexity analysis

stability information

performance metrics (comparisons, swaps, execution time)

⚙️ Features
✅ 1. Multiple Data Structure Support

User can select:

Array

Linked List

Stack

Queue

This helps demonstrate data structure awareness and limitations.

✅ 2. Sorting Algorithms Implemented

Bubble Sort

Selection Sort

Insertion Sort

Quick Sort

Merge Sort

Each algorithm is implemented from scratch using Java.

✅ 3. Data Nature Detection

The system analyzes input data and classifies it as:

Sorted

Nearly Sorted

Random

It also calculates a disorder level, which helps in choosing the best algorithm.

✅ 4. Intelligent Algorithm Recommendation

Based on:

data nature

disorder level

chosen data structure

The system recommends the most suitable sorting algorithm and explains why it is optimal.

✅ 5. User Choice Analysis

If the user selects a non-optimal algorithm, the system:

highlights the issue

explains why it may be inefficient

This feature improves learning and decision-making.

✅ 6. Performance Metrics

After sorting, the system displays:

number of comparisons

number of swaps

execution time

sorted output

This gives a practical understanding of algorithm efficiency.
